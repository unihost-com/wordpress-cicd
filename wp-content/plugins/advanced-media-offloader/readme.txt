Offload WordPress media to Amazon S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, Min.io or Cloudflare R2.

== Description ==

Advanced Media Offloader automatically uploads media attachments from your WordPress site to an S3-compatible cloud storage, replacing the URLs appropriately to serve the media from the cloud. This can help reduce server load, increase page speed, and optimize media delivery.

== Features ==

- Automatic upload of new media attachments to S3-compatible cloud storage.
- Rewrites URLs for media files to serve them directly from cloud storage.
- Bulk offload media to cloud storage (50 files per batch in the free version).
- Provides hooks for further extension.

1. In your WordPress admin panel, go to Plugins > Add New.
2. Search for "Advanced Media Offloader" and click "Install Now".
3. Once installed, click "Activate" to enable the plugin.
4. After activation, go to "Media Offloader" in the WordPress dashboard to access the plugin settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin support other cloud storage platforms? =

Currently, the plugin supports only Cloudflare R2, DigitalOcean Spaces, Amazon S3 & MinIO, but we are working on adding support for other cloud storage platforms.

= What happens to the media files already uploaded on my server? =

They will remain on your server and be served from there. You can choose to bulk offload them to cloud storage if needed.

= How does the plugin handle loading images from cloud storage? =

The plugin automatically detects and rewrites URLs for uploaded files, enabling them to be served directly from cloud storage.

= What happens to my files after offloading them to cloud storage? =

After offloading to the cloud, files remain on your server by default. However, in the plugin settings, you can enable “Smart Local Cleanup” to retain only the original file after offloading, or select “Full Cloud Migration” to remove all local files.

= What happens if I remove a media file from the WordPress Media Library? =

If the “Mirror Delete” option is enabled in the plugin settings, the corresponding file will also be removed from cloud storage. Otherwise, the file will remain in cloud storage even after being deleted from the WordPress Media Library.

== Using the S3 PHP SDK ==

The Advanced Media Offloader utilizes the AWS SDK for PHP to interact with S3-compatible cloud storage. This powerful SDK provides an easy-to-use API for managing your cloud storage operations, including file uploads, downloads, and more. The SDK is maintained by Amazon Web Services, ensuring high compatibility and performance with S3 services.

For more information about the AWS SDK for PHP, visit:
